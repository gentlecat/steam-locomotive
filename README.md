Steam Locomotive is a PHP wrapper for Steam Web API with useful tools such as Steam ID converters, validators, etc.

**⚠️Please note that this project is no longer actively maintained!** The best way to make a
change is by submitting a pull request. You can add missing interface, fix function
that is not working properly or do something else. Any improvements are welcome!

## How it works

This library wraps interfaces provided by Steam Web API into PHP classes and functions.
It simplifies communication with Steam while preserving original structure of its API.
Each interface, method, and parameter has the same name so you can easily start using this
library if you worked with Steam Web API before.

Also, this library provides some useful tools that are not available in official API,
but might be needed. You can get additional details about applications, store, prices;
convert Steam ID or validate one.

### Returned data format
In most cases functions return JSON that is decoded using [`json_decode`](http://php.net/json_decode) function.
*See PHPDoc comments to find out more about data returned by each function.*

## Usage example

    use Tsukanov\SteamLocomotive\Locomotive;
    $steam = new Locomotive(YOUR_STEAM_API_KEY);
	
	// Getting information about heroes in Dota 2
    $response = $steam->IEconDOTA2_570->GetHeroes();
